## Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

- ### First Time Visitor Goals
    1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to navigate the website with ease.
        - Application is clean, free of extensive functions and in a color-pallete that is easy to read.
        - All the functions are placed in the screen, so that there is no need to unfold or scroll through menu.

    2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to find out how the game works.
        - When entering the website, user is greeted with clear and simple instructions page, where the basics of the game are explained.
        - Last part of the instructions page gives user the ability to control the tune that is playing in the background.
        - Button placed at the bottom of the page allows you to jump into game without any further delays and immediately after reading the instructions.
        - Link to my github repository was placed to simply advertise my work to potential users.

    3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to play the game.
        - The character of the brand icons, the color palette and the tune used were meant to be eye-catchy and pleasant to use.
        - There are no pop-up windows and user is able to jump straight into action without any delays.
        - The Instruction button is located conveniently just above the game screen, for easy access, should user need it.
        - User is able to track their time, score and amount of moves made in real time, thanks to the counters located at teh top of the game window.
        - User is able to control the tune while playing the game.
        - Thanks to Restart button located at the bottom of the page, user can restart the game at anytime. By doing so, user also restarts the counters.

    4. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to find out what my score is at the end of the game.
        - The pop-up window will display the final score, time spent in game and amount of moves when the game is finished.
        - In the future development, the said pop-up screen will allow user to invite other people to play the game and will allow the access to the leaderboard.
    
- ### Returning Visitor Goals
    1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to play the game and get better at it.
        - Thanks to the stats run by the application, user can see how they did each time they play.
        - User can come back anytime and play as many time as they want.
        - User can restart the game at any time using the restart button.

        - The total time the user has been playing is also displayed in the final pop-up that shows the final stats when the game is finished.


## Further Testing
Browsers:

- Project was tested by myself in Chrome browser only. Mozilla and Firefox browsers were crashing my laptop when installed. I tried to fix this issue, but it seems that due to equipment malfunction, I could only test this project in Chrome.

- Testing using Mozilla and Firefox browsers was done by a friend, who said that Mozilla takes longer than Firefox to open the website, and that no other issues were spotted.

Desktop, Tablet & Mobile view:

- Website's responsiveness was tested on mobile devices with a use of:

    - ["Am I responsive"](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/#) facility.

    - Google Chrome DevTools.

- Application was viewed and tested on desktop, laptop, iPad Air, Huawei P30 Lite, and Samsung Galaxy A3.

- Most testing was done to assure the correct layout and the game's functionalities.

- Friends were asked to also test the application for bugs, etc.

Modals:

- Instructions modal opens from the main page by clicking on the **Instructions** button. Modal pops opened each time without a fail.

- Success modal pops open upon completion of the game. Modal opened each time without a fail.

Score Board:

- Timer starts running the moment the first icon is clicked upon.

- Moves counter shows new move each time user clicks the icon.

- Reset function works when clicked upon and resets the counters and the screen, esentially reseting the game.

Readme file:

- Table of contents remains interactive and takes user to correct parts of the file.

- Back-to-top link feature was added at the end of each chapter to allow user to easily navigate the file.

# Deployment

## Creating this project

- I have used the cloud-based IDE [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/) and [GitHub](http://github.com/) as a free git repository hosting.

- As first step, I have installed the [Gitpod extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gitpod-dev-environments-i/dodmmooeoklaejobgleioelladacbeki) for Chrome browser that I use.

- Next, I created the repository on [Github](https://github.com/) using the gitpod template provided by the [Code Institute](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template).

- Then, I clicked on "Gitpod" button, which opened workspace in Gitpod, where I created my project.

- Once in Gitpod, the following commands were used while developing this project:
    - "git add (file name)" - to add files for staging.
    - "git status" - to see what is the current status of directory and staging area.
    - "git commit -m "(description of action taken)" - to commit changes along with short comment of what was done.
    - "git push" - to push commits to Github.
    - "python3 -m http.server" - to open ports allowing me to view the current state of the website in Chrome.

## Github pages

- Log in to Github and find the repository.

- At the top of the repository (not in the header of the whole page) find the "Settings" button with a cogwheel icon and click on it.

- Scroll down to "Github Pages" section.

- Click on dropdown called "None" and select "Master Branch" so it looks like in the image below ![screenshot](./documentation/screenshots/githubpages1.jpg)

- Click save next to it and wait for the page to refresh automatically. You will be taken back to the top of the settings page.

- Scroll back down again to "Github Pages" section and find the link of now published page.

## Running project locally

- In order to run this project locally, follow the below steps:

    - Click on the [link](https://github.com/LucasCegielski/MS2-Brands_memory_game) to this project's repository in GitHub (you must be logged into your own Github account).
    - Click on the dropdown menu Code button located next to green "Gitpod" button.
    - Click on "Open with GitHub Desktop" to clone and open the repository locally.
    - Click on the "Choose" option and navigate to the local path where the cloned repository should be located.
    - Click "Clone".

- For more details on how to clone repository in Github see [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository).
